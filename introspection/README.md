# Introspection

### Why must we choose you?
I love to code and its pretty much one of the few things i am genuinely interseted in and if I get into the club I could improve my skills.

### What is your plan for the next 6 months?
I'm planning on leveling up my flutter knowledge as I have only started learning about it a few months ago and it seems fun to do.

### How would you contribute back to the club?
I'll hopefully contribute some code on projects and stuff and I'll share my knowledge with others with what i have learnt.

### Do you have any feedback for the selection process?
Not Really.
